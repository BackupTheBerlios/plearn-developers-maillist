<PRE>Dear fellow PLearners,

As most of you are aware, Berlios has been unable to accept new commits 
to PLearn since last Thursday July 27th 2006**.  This is due to a disk 
that has been filled up on Berlios.  The administrators have been 
notified, and at last count, some 12 messages from a variety of projets 
hosted on Berlios had been sent to the main Berlios mailing list 
(including our own messages).  However, no official reply has yet been 
forthcoming.

Since this unfortunate situation greatly impedes the development of 
PLearn, the self-appointed Triumvirate (Pascal Vincent, Christian Hudon, 
Nicolas Chapados) is giving itself until WEDNESDAY AUGUST 2nd for the 
situation to get back to normal.  Past this date, we will move PLearn 
back to Sourceforge, which now has Subversion hosting.  At a later 
point, we may consider moving to Google Code, once their environment 
becomes more mature (and can import revision histories from existing 
projects, which is not currently the case).

Don't hesitate to share concerns or observations.

    + Nicolas

** There was a brief period on Sunday were commits were permitted, but 
the server quickly filled up.
