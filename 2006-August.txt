Subject: [Plearn-developers] Berlios Full and What We Intend to do About It
Message-ID: <44CE7EB9.3090109@apstat.com>

Dear fellow PLearners,

As most of you are aware, Berlios has been unable to accept new commits 
to PLearn since last Thursday July 27th 2006**.  This is due to a disk 
that has been filled up on Berlios.  The administrators have been 
notified, and at last count, some 12 messages from a variety of projets 
hosted on Berlios had been sent to the main Berlios mailing list 
(including our own messages).  However, no official reply has yet been 
forthcoming.

Since this unfortunate situation greatly impedes the development of 
PLearn, the self-appointed Triumvirate (Pascal Vincent, Christian Hudon, 
Nicolas Chapados) is giving itself until WEDNESDAY AUGUST 2nd for the 
situation to get back to normal.  Past this date, we will move PLearn 
back to Sourceforge, which now has Subversion hosting.  At a later 
point, we may consider moving to Google Code, once their environment 
becomes more mature (and can import revision histories from existing 
projects, which is not currently the case).

Don't hesitate to share concerns or observations.

    + Nicolas

** There was a brief period on Sunday were commits were permitted, but 
the server quickly filled up.

Subject: [Plearn-developers] PLearn buildbot is back
Message-ID: <44CF7763.6060406@apstat.com>

Hi,

some people might have noticed that the PLearn buildbot was rather
grumpy in the past few days. This was due to an upgrade of the machine
it is running on from Debian to Ubuntu 6.06. After a little bit of
reeducation, the PLearn buildbot is now back on duty, fit as a fiddle
and ready to send people who make the PLearn tests fail threatening emails.

Enjoy, and sorry for the disturbance.

  Christian
