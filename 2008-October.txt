Subject: [Plearn-developers] A new runable object to redirect perr and pout
Message-ID: <2d1d7fe70810031202k6931e42i7f5a80813705e597@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I implemented a new runable object that allow the redirection of perr
and pout in a .plearn script. I use it to redirect them in the expdir.

example:
...
$EVALUATE{expdir}

Redirect(what="pout",filename="${expdir}/stdout")
Redirect(what="perr",filename="${expdir}/stderr")
PTester(...)

Subject: [Plearn-developers] New sorting keys in vmat view
Message-ID: <20081015150808.GA27197@opale.iro.umontreal.ca>

I just added in the "vmat view" command a little feature that can be
useful when reading results tables: pressing < or > will sort rows
according to the selected column, in respectively increasing or
decreasing order.

Have fun :)

Subject: [Plearn-developers] LIBSVMSparseVMatrix
Message-ID: <A591D854-0B01-4B57-9CC6-6925B64E1FC3@iro.umontreal.ca>

I just finished implementing, LIBSVMSparseVMatrix, a VMatrix that can  
directly take its data from a .libsvm file.

The libsvm format file is particularly useful for sparse inputs. In  
this class, the sparsity information (i.e. indices of non-zero  
inputs) is provided via the extra fields, and the input given by  
getExample() only contains the values for the non-zero inputs. Since  
the sparsity can change from one example to another, getExtra() (and  
getExample()) will adapt the size of the extra (input) fields vector  
accordingly. However, since it only works for fixed length inputs,  
getRow() returns an error when called in sparse mode.

This class can also be used in "coarse" mode (i.e.  
use_coarse_representation=true), where getRow() and getExample() will  
then provide inputs in a fixed vector form, with non-zero fields  
taking their given values and other fields set explicitely to 0.  
However, in coarse mode, no extra information is given (i.e. extrasize 
() is 0), since it is implicitly incorporated in the input vector.

Hi,

I did a bug fix in HyperOptimize. It don't break test here, but their
is some chance that it break some others at apstats. Olivier D. and
Pascal agree with the fix. So this email is to leat people know what
changed in case something break.

New Revision: 9586

Modified:
  trunk/plearn_learners/hyper/HyperOptimize.cc
Log:
corrected the option HyperOptimize::min_n_trials so that if it is 10
do a mininum of 10 trials and not 11 as in the past.
