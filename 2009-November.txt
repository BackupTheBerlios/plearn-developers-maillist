Subject: [Plearn-developers] Bug with ParzenWindow.cc (?)
Message-ID: <daecc3cb0911270711n4e0df0fcse8e667c0c1a83fe1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

While reimplementing a Parzen window  density estimator in Theano, I
noticed a little discrepancy between my results and those returned by
PLearn...
Basically, to get the same results, I have to treat the sigma^2
parameter of the (spherical) Gaussian kernel, as the standard
deviation.

This seems to be confirmed by looking at the code. ParzenWindow's
constructor takes as input a sigma_square parameter. ParzenWindow
extends the GaussMix class however, which computes the likelihood as
follows:

real stddev = type_id == TYPE_SPHERICAL ? sigma[j] : diag_j[k];
stddev = max(sigma_min, stddev);
log_likelihood += gauss_log_density_stddev(y[k], mu_y[k], stddev);

Everything's good so far... except that ParzenWindow initializes the
sigma[j]'s with sigma_square !
(plearn_learners/distributions/ParzenWindow.cc:164).
So it looks like the "sigma_square" parameter to ParzenWindow is
actually the standard deviation, and should thus be renamed to
"sigma".

Before going through with the change I'd like to confirm that I'm not
missing something. I'm not very familiar with PLearn, so I'd like to
make sure this change would not have any unintended side-effects.

Thanks in advance,

Guillaume

I confirm it is a bug (or at least a bad option name).
