Subject: [Plearn-developers] New default values for PTester.save_mode and
	HyperLearner.save_mode
Message-ID: <20090527204044.GA27574@opale.iro.umontreal.ca>

Just a note that the default value for PTester.save_mode and
HyperLearner.save_mode has been changed to
    "plearn_ascii"
instead of
    ""
for the sake of clarity.

It may cause some recently added (not in PLearn) tests to fail, so if it
happens, you'll know why :)
