Subject: [Plearn-developers] GaussianizeVMatrix default behavior changed.
Message-ID: <2d1d7fe70801291328r27fe89b2n211edd94f2a44749@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I changed the default behavior of GaussianizeVMatrix!

I added a build option, gaussianize_binary, in GaussianizeVMatrix.
When false binary variable are not gaussianized.
The default value is false. This change the default behavior as in the
past only the threshold is used. In some case in the old version
binary variable was gaussianised. So if you use it in your experiment,
check them...
