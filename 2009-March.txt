Subject: [Plearn-developers] Drop support of python2.3?
Message-ID: <2d1d7fe70903041132g3cb52256wd7156a32eb8e3e0b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have modified PLearn to be able to link again python 2.6. It is
work, with one exception that make the test fail. We have this
DeprecationWarning that is generated as we use popen2 that is
deprecated. We could use the subprocess instead, but it was added in
python 2.4. So is their anybody with objection that we don't officialy
support python2.3 to allow using python 2.6? Do you know how to use
the subprocess package on python 2.3?

Here is the warning:

/home/bastienf/PLearn/python_modules/plearn/utilities/toolkit.py:8: DeprecationW
arning: The popen2 module is deprecated.  Use the subprocess module.
  import inspect, os, popen2, shutil, string, sys, time, types

We need to use python2.6 the new mammouth serie.

thanks

Fred

I don't mind if we drop support for python 2.3.  I like backward
compatibility, but I don't think it is necessary to support things that
were replaced some five years ago.

A stand-alone subprocess module is available here if we need it:
http://www.lysator.liu.se/~astrand/popen5/

There are other ways to make a self-contained toolkit.py that would be
compatible with as many versions of python as possible...  if it is
worth the trouble.

Hi,

a fast fix is to don't include this file if you don't need it. To do this
comment the line 257 in the file commands/plearn_noblas_inc.h

here is this line to comment.

#include <plearn_learners/online/ShuntingNNetLayerModule.h>

Hi,

I have commited a fix update plearn to have it. The trouble is that the fct
that exist is
multiplyAcc(PLearn::Mat&, PLearn::Mat&, real)
and it is
multiplyAcc(PLearn::Mat&, PLearn::Mat&, int)

that is called. Here the compiler cast the int to real(float or double, that
is selected at compile time) automaticly.
What is the compiler that you used and which version?

thanks

Fred

Hi Frederic & Pascal,

  Many thanks for your quick reply. It did solve this compilation problem. I
am still struggling with some link time issues but I will first try to
resolve them by myself before further bothering you.

Take care,
Olivier

Hi,

Just a quick help about compilation. This is the flags that I use most
often:

to compile
pymake $PLEARNDIR/commands/plearn_{full,noblas,...}

this will compile in debug mode. To compile in opt mode:
pymake -opt $PLEARNDIR/commands/plearn_{full,noblas,...}

To speed up the link time if your plearndir is on nfs:
pymake -local_ofiles $PLEARNDIR/commands/plearn_{full,noblas,...}

for parallel compilation on an SMP host where N is the number of parallel
threads:
pymake -local=N $PLEARNDIR/commands/plearn_{full,noblas,...}

You can also make parallel compilation on many computer with ssh if you need
to compile it many times(likes us when we devellop for it)

To control the compilation verbosity their is the -v, -vv, -vvv, -vvvv
option that default to -vv if I remember correctly.

Fred

Hi,

Will using some new optimisation that used PP, I discovered that PP are not
thread safe as the count the number of reference. If I put lock around the
modification of the lock, this is too slow, so I removed their creation
inside my parallel region.

This is just to let you know.

Hi,

I just did too commit, one that make plearn vmat diff compare the
field name and field type of the two matrix. The second it contain fix
for the test. I don't know if this will make the ApStats test fail, so
I just let you know.
