Subject: [Plearn-developers] Cleanup of unitialized defaults...
Message-ID: <42BC911F.7050903@apstat.com>

Hello all,

Just a quick note that the next svn update of PLearn will probably turn 
up more than its fair share of changes.  I spent the better part of the 
afternoon tracking down uninitialized default variables in many PLearn 
classes, and adding initializations as appropriate.  These changes 
should NOT change the behavior of the code; if they do, they are simply 
revealing that the old code was erroneous, and you should reconsider 
results that depend on it.

Oh, and in a few cases, I did put a few more help strings as well. :-)

I warmly encourage all PLearn coders to "back-document" the code as they 
encounter undocumented classes.  Just add the appropriate help to the 
PLEARN_IMPLEMENT_OBJECT declarations and to declareOption() calls in the 
.cc files, and they will be automatically reflected in the HTML help 
(when it's next updated).

    + Nicolas
