<PRE>Dear all fellow PLearners,

Few people know about it, but PLearn has supported a *remote method 
invokation* mechanism for all PLearn Objects for over a year.  This lets 
you run PLearn in *server mode* (using the &quot;server&quot; command), where it 
waits for connections and dispatches method calls to instantiated objects.

Until today however, making your objects &quot;remote-callable&quot; involved a 
complicated procedure: you had to override the Object::call() method, 
handle argument and return value marshalling/unmarshalling, etc, for 
EACH method to be &quot;published&quot; outside.  Furthermore, there was no way to 
query an object as to what methods are remote-callable, or to attach 
documentation to them.

In order to make more of PLearn remote-callable, and not lose our 
collective sanity, I am pleased to announce a new mechanism to declare 
remote methods, called quite appropriately &quot;declareMethods&quot;, and similar 
to the existing &quot;declareOptions&quot;.  The idea is as follows: for each C++ 
member function that you want to make available remotely, you simply 
declare it with a &quot;declareMethod&quot;, give it a remote name and some 
documentation. Most functions do not even have to know that they will be 
called from afar, as all the necessary wrapping code is generated 
automatically!  For example:

    // It is necessary to inherit directly or indirectly from PLearn::Object
    class X : public PLearn::Object
    {
    public:
        //! This method is to be published for remote invocation. Note that 
        //! we accept normal C++ argument types and return normal types.  The
        //! only requirement is for those types to be serializable to a PStream.
        //! All wrapping to a PStream representation is handled automatically
        //! by the declareMethod below
        Vec complexServerCalculation(Vec inputs, const map&lt;string,real&gt;&amp; params);

    protected:
        //! This is where remote method declaration happens
        static void declareMethods(RemoteMethodMap&amp; rmm);

        //! Plus the usual PLearn poutine in the class definition...
    };

    void X::declareMethods(RemoteMethodMap&amp; rmm)
    {
        // Make sure that inherited methods are declared
        rmm.inherited(inherited::_getRemoteMethodMap_());

        // Insert class-specific methods
        declareMethod(rmm, &quot;complexServerCalculation&quot;, &amp;X::complexServerCalculation,
                      (BodyDoc(&quot;This function carries out a computation of such\n&quot;
                               &quot;complexity that it should only be attempted on a\n&quot;
                               &quot;capable server.&quot;),
                       ArgDoc (&quot;inputs&quot;, &quot;Vector of inputs for the computation&quot;),
                       ArgDoc (&quot;params&quot;, &quot;Additional parameters that will condition\n&quot;
                                         &quot;the operations&quot;),
                       RetDoc (&quot;The return value is a vector of computed results.&quot;)));
    } 
            


Notice the following points:

   1. It is no longer necessary to override Object::call() for having
      remote methods.
   2. Normal C++ member functions can easily be exported with no
      additional fuss; you don't need to write special code that is
      remote-callable.  (Although in some contexts it may be necessary
      as you won't necessarily have precisely the same interface).
   3. You don't need to declare the argument types or return value type
      of &quot;complexServerCalculation&quot; in the *declareMethod*.  This is
      inferred automatically, thanks to C++ (also called &quot;deep template
      voodoo&quot; in polite company).
   4. Documentation can be attached to the method and given some
      semantics. In the above, &quot;BodyDoc&quot; means the main documentation of
      the function, and should explain the purpose. &quot;ArgDoc&quot; means
      argument documentation, and there should be one such element per
      function argument: the order of declaration is important for
      ArgDocs and must match the function argument order! Finally,
      &quot;RetDoc&quot; means return value documentation, and should explain how
      the return value should be interpreted.
   5. There is an additional pair of parenthesis around the
      documentation components: don't dare forget it!

The HTMLHelpCommand has been updated to automatically query all classes 
for their remote methods, and outputs a very nice documentation for all 
of them. This documentation is accessible from Plide or the PLearn 
website, which will be updated. At the moment, most remote methods are 
the standard ones declared at the level of PLearn::Object, but PLearner 
and PTester have both been upgraded to the new mechanism, so you can 
look at these classes to get an idea of what is possible.

Comments, flowers, gifts, dark chocolate, and suggestions welcome!

    + Nicolas
