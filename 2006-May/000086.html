<PRE>Having a FAQ is certainly a good idea. However, don't forget there is
(supposed to be) a manual too. Some of the FAQ's questions should
probably refer to a section in the manual (rather than duplicate its
content). This is not a criticism (I actually haven't looked at the FAQ
yet), just an advice for future FAQ updates (updating the manual at the
same time would be nice ;)
