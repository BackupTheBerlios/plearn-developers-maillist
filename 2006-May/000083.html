<PRE>Hello fellow PLearners,

I've just comitted a long due change: adding an extrasize_ to VMatrix.
The semantic is now that the row of a VMatrix as understood from a 
PLearner is made of
inputsize_ input fields
followed by targetsize_ target fields
followed by weightsize_ (1 or 0) sample weight fields
followed by extrasize_ extra fields

The extra fields serve to put additional information that should neither 
be considered a learner's input, target or a sample weight, but may be 
used for other things (such as performance assessment).

I also added a new method getExtra to access the extra info (which 
complements the already existing getExample method)

    //! Default version calls getSubRow based on inputsize_ targetsize_ 
weightsize_
    //! But exotic subclasses may construct, input, target and weight 
however they please.
    //! If not a weighted matrix, weight should be set to default value 1.
    virtual void getExample(int i, Vec&amp; input, Vec&amp; target, real&amp; weight);

    //! Complements the getExample method, fetching the the extrasize_ 
&quot;extra&quot; fields
    //! expected to appear after the input, target and weight fields
    //! Default version calls getSubRow based on inputsize_ targetsize_ 
weightsize_ and extrasize_
    virtual void getExtra(int i, Vec&amp; extra);

(Note to self: these methods should some day be made const, and in all 
subclasses as well)

Note that all the testsuite passes.

Also extrasize_ defaults to zero. Thus all current code using *current 
datasets* should still work exactly as before.

Also nothing currently *enforces* 
inputsize_+targetsize_+weightsize_+extrasize_ to be equal to width_ 
(although it is recommended that it be the case), so that old code that 
used extra fields beyond the weight and inferred their size from width_ 
should still work (but could be corrected for clarity).

Now of course things may go sour if you make up a *new* dataset with a 
non-zero extrasize and pass it through VMatrix processing or learners 
that enforce or suppose that
inputsize_+targetsize_+weightsize_ == width_  (incriminating ex: 
fetching the weight with v[width_-1] is wrong!).
So you may need to make a few minor modifications to the code to 
properly handle VMatrixes with non-zero extrasize_

Should this little incremental change of mine cause the Earth to stop 
revolving around the Sun, you/we may go back to previous version that 
was tagged under SVN: tags/before_adding_VMatrix_extrasize

Have fun!
