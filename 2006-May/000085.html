<PRE>Dear fellow PLearners,

I have added a document under svn (doc/faq.tex) which will( hopefully in the
very near future ) contain answers to most of the questions people have
related to PLearn.

The aim of this document is to provide quick answers to questions like which
function computes this, or how can I quickly create a new test case using
PyTest. An up to date document of this kind should save a considerable
amount of time to many people.

If you have been asked the same question twice, just take one minute and add
it to the document. If everything works well you won't have to answer it the
third time.

Each entry has an author associated with it. If you think the response of a
questions could be improved, just contact the author and make the necessary
changes.

I'll make sure the document is properly organized as more entries are added
to the document.

Regards,
Dan
