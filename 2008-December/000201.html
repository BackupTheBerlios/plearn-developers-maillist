I agree with the idea of having a different default for logging 
depending on the compilation options; this was already possible with the 
pymake option &quot;-logging=...&quot; but I have no problem if &quot;-dbg&quot; also 
implies &quot;-logging=dbg&quot;, as long as it can still be overriden with 
another &quot;-logging=...&quot; option.  I also think that non-debug modes 
should, by default, not print any debug-related messages.

As for which module logs should be displayed by default, again I think 
that the most verbose option should apply only to debug modes (is it 
what you had in mind?)  That is, I think the default for any non-debug 
compilation should remain &quot;__NONE__&quot;.  Also, it might be useful to 
consider implementing a way to omit some modules when the default is 
&quot;__ALL__&quot;; it may become necessary if, for example, PP is instrumented 
to log all refs and unrefs.  As another example, I am currently 
debugging the PLearn&lt;-&gt;Python bridge (to allow parallel execution) and I 
think most people will want to omit debug logs from PythonObjectWrapper 
and PythonExtension once I'm done; I would rather not have to remove all 
logs since they may be useful again in the future (and it would defeat 
the purpose of logs altogether.)

What remains to be solved is the exact definition of the different 
logging levels.  We probably need to start using it and experimenting 
with it before we can take any final decision.  For now, the following 
examples illustrate messages which I think may belong to different levels:
1- low-level core system debugging information; e.g. logging each ref 
and unref to every PP
2- machine-learning-related low-level information; e.g. number of rows 
selected by SelectRowsVMatrix
3- machine-learning-related potential errors; e.g. warning for bagging 
with several identical bags
4- user-oriented low-level information; e.g. validation error at each 
stage of hyper-learning
5- global progress information; e.g. start of a new split
Does this list make sense to you?  If so, how would you assign each of 
these messages to the different levels of logs?
