Subject: [Plearn-developers] Change in the default behavior of PTester?
Message-ID: <2d1d7fe70901211022v33ad953fubf3ffb6026e38b7f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

in the commit 9862, I added flags to PLearner and PTester. The current
default don't change the current behavior, but I think that we should change
the default. The flag in PLearner::finalized was added. This flag default to
false, but when the fct PLearner::finilize() is called, it set the flag to
true. When PLearner::forget() is called the flag is set to false.
This is to remember when the training of a learner is supposed to be
finished. This allow some optimisation in the memory usage at load time and
I need those optimization.

Also, the flag PTester::finalise_learner was added with the default value of
false. If true, will call learner->finalize() after the training.
The current default is the current behavior. I would change it so that be
default, we finalize the learner after the training. Is their any objection?
If not, I will do so. This will break many test because the value of the
flags will change, but I can change them in PLearn, but I can't do it at
Apstat.

Sorry for this late answer.  I have no problem with this modification.
