Subject: [Plearn-developers] PStream::operator bool() is gone
Message-ID: <4856AF14.8010102@apstat.com>

Hello,

I am about to commit a change that removes the implicit conversion of 
PStream to bool.  The reason for this change is that allowing this 
implicit conversion can lead to some very obscure bugs.  The "clean" 
solution is to use the good() method explicitly; e.g.:

while(cin) {...}

becomes:

while(cin.good()) {...}

I already went through PLearn to make this change where it was needed.  
If I missed something, please let me know and I'll fix it.

Xavier

Hi,

with gcc 4.3.0 I got an error. To correct it I need to rename
plearn/base/RealMapping::map to plearn/base/RealMapping::mapto. I have
all the modification in my version and all the test pass. Can I commit
it safely of this will break stuff at apstat?

thanks

Frederic Bastien

Hi,

With Xavier we found another fix that don't ask to rename the
function. So their will be no need for cascade change.

thanks

Fred
