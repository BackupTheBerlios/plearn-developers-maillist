<PRE>Just to let you know, the Boost guys have unfortunately changed the
Mersenne Twister seeding algorithm (it is supposed to be better now) in
Boost 1.33, compared to Boost 1.32.
Unfortunately, the PRandom number generator relies on this specific
Boost random number generator, and thus its behavior has changed too.

Right now, it should not have too many consequences as not many classes
use the new PRandom number generator, namely:
- ThresholdedKernel
- BootstrapVMatrix
- SelectRowsMultiInstanceVMatrix
- GaussMix

Currently Boost 1.33 is installed at DIRO, but Boost 1.32 is still
installed on the Mammouth-Serie cluster (mainly because 1.33.0 is not
compatible with Intel Compiler, and I need to checkout a 1.33.1 cvs
snapshot to get it compiled). I will thus take the step to upgrade the
latter to Boost 1.33 very soon, as soon as the following question is
answered: if you need to still use the old seeding algorithm in order to
be able to repeat some important experiments, let me know
(Pierre-Jean?).

Note also that this difference will make the TMat_maths test fail with
Boost 1.32.

Hopefully they will not change it again in the future (fingers crossed).
