Subject: [Plearn-developers] PythonCodeSnippet :: change in method names
Message-ID: <434BE2BC.60000@apstat.com>

Hello all,

At Olivier's request and Christian Dorion's suggestion, I changed the 
method name to call Python functions in PythonCodeSnippet from 'call' to 
'invoke', and 'isCallable' to 'isInvokable'.  All test cases have been 
updated to reflect the change.  However, YOUR client code will have to 
be updated (if you use PythonCodeSnippet at all).  This change was made 
to minimize conflict with PLearn::Object, which already defines a method 
'call' for the remote method invokation mechanism.
