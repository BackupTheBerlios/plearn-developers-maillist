Subject: [Plearn-developers] Default value for logging
Message-ID: <2d1d7fe70812021038m4ecfdb89n4fe15970df616fda@mail.gmail.com>

Following some discussion with Nicolas, I think that we should change
some default value about the logging.

1) with pymake -dbg, should print de debug level of log
2) The named log should be on for all module by default.
That way new plearn developer won't miss log that they need and old
developer could target the log they want. This will solve all
objection that was raised about moving from PLWARNING to *LOG.

Nicolas agreed with those change. Is their objection that I do the change?

I agree with the idea of having a different default for logging 
depending on the compilation options; this was already possible with the 
pymake option "-logging=..." but I have no problem if "-dbg" also 
implies "-logging=dbg", as long as it can still be overriden with 
another "-logging=..." option.  I also think that non-debug modes 
should, by default, not print any debug-related messages.

As for which module logs should be displayed by default, again I think 
that the most verbose option should apply only to debug modes (is it 
what you had in mind?)  That is, I think the default for any non-debug 
compilation should remain "__NONE__".  Also, it might be useful to 
consider implementing a way to omit some modules when the default is 
"__ALL__"; it may become necessary if, for example, PP is instrumented 
to log all refs and unrefs.  As another example, I am currently 
debugging the PLearn<->Python bridge (to allow parallel execution) and I 
think most people will want to omit debug logs from PythonObjectWrapper 
and PythonExtension once I'm done; I would rather not have to remove all 
logs since they may be useful again in the future (and it would defeat 
the purpose of logs altogether.)

What remains to be solved is the exact definition of the different 
logging levels.  We probably need to start using it and experimenting 
with it before we can take any final decision.  For now, the following 
examples illustrate messages which I think may belong to different levels:
1- low-level core system debugging information; e.g. logging each ref 
and unref to every PP
2- machine-learning-related low-level information; e.g. number of rows 
selected by SelectRowsVMatrix
3- machine-learning-related potential errors; e.g. warning for bagging 
with several identical bags
4- user-oriented low-level information; e.g. validation error at each 
stage of hyper-learning
5- global progress information; e.g. start of a new split
Does this list make sense to you?  If so, how would you assign each of 
these messages to the different levels of logs?

I think debug logs (in the sense of being useful for debug code) should
never show by default, but it should not be a module-level exclusion,
but instead be based on the specific log level.
Which I believe is what you're coming to in the following...

Maybe I missed a part of the discussion at some point, but I thought
initially the plan was just to get rid of PLWARNING. Are we now also
trying to get rid of the direct use of pout/perr at the same time? If
yes, isn't it going to be somewhat redundant with the verbosity / 
report_progress options in some classes? (without the flexibility of
being able to tweak the logging level for each instance of a class).
Just trying to understand what's the plan here.

Oops, in case this would make no sense, I meant "useful TO debug code".
