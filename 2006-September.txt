Dear PLearners,

This is to announce the availability of a new general-interest learner 
called BestAveragingPLearner.  The idea stems from a common problem 
encountered when training neural networks: what can you do if you fall 
in a bad local minimum?  The easy answer is easy: start the optimization 
again!  But what if you want to automate the process, without a human in 
the loop?

BestAveragingPLearner is the answer.  In operation, it is very simple:

    * It trains N underlying models (e.g. neural nets initialized with a
      different seed)
    * It selects M of those models based on a train cost (e.g. E[mse]),
      where, obviously, 0 < M <= N.
    * At computeOutput time, it takes the simple arithmetic average of
      the output of the M selected models.

An example of how to use it is provided in the test-case, under:

    
$PLEARNDIR/plearn_learners/generic/test/BestAveragingPLearner/best_avg_nnet.pyplearn

Obviously, this class can be enhanced in many ways, and already Yoshua 
has an impressive laundry list of improvements to implement.  Your own 
comments and suggestions are of course welcome.

    Enjoy!
    + Nicolas
