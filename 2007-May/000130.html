<PRE>Here is a brief summary on how to use the new OnlineLearningModule
features in a ModuleLearner to learn some complex networks:

- There is no explicit notion of 'input' and 'output' anymore. Instead,
an OnlineLearningModule has some 'ports' you can use to send/retrieve
data (it's up to the module to crash if a port is meant to be only read
or written). Each port takes a value (represented by a matrix), and can
be provided with some gradient (or asked to compute some gradient).

- The fprop method thus takes as input a list of matrices. More
precisely, it is a TVec&lt;Mat*&gt;. A full matrix indicates a value
provided as input. An empty matrix indicates a value we want to retrieve
(so the matrix will be resized within the module), and a NULL matrix is
a port whose value is of no interest to the caller.

- Similarly, the brop method takes a list of matrices (the gradients),
where a full matrix is a provided gradient, an empty matrix is a
gradient we wish to compute, and a NULL pointer a gradient that we do
not care about. Note that the bprop method is actually named
bpropAccUpdate, ie:
    (i) it systematically ACCUMULATES the gradient: an empty matrix we
want to accumulate into must have its width set to the correct witdth,
and length 0 (we use the fact that PLearn does not erase previous data
when resizing)
    (2) it also updates the module's internal parameters (usually using
the gradient provided as input)

- You can still use most old OnlineLearningModules as there are default
mechanisms to define two ports (&quot;input&quot; and &quot;output&quot;), forwarding the
fprop and bpropAccUpdate methods to the corresponding mini-batch
existing implementations (and hopefully crashing if you try to use the
&quot;input&quot; port as an output).

- Remember to always run your experiments first in debug mode, there are
  a lot of safety checks that are skipped in optimized mode.

- Each OnlineLearningModule can now be given a name (see below for its
  use)

- There is a new module called NetworkModule that you can use to plug
OnlineLearningModules together. It takes mainly 3 options:
    (1) a list of modules
    (2) a list of connections between modules (each connection is
defined by its source and destination, as a string whose format is
&quot;module_name.port_name&quot;).
    (3) a list of ports that can be accessed from the outside, and which
redirect towards ports of some modules in the network. For instance:
ports = [ &quot;input&quot;  &quot;rbm.visible&quot;
          &quot;target&quot; &quot;nll.target&quot;
          &quot;output&quot; &quot;rbm.hidden&quot;
          &quot;cost&quot;   &quot;nll.cost&quot;
        ]
means the NetworkModule has four ports (named input, target, output and
cost).

- You can optimize an OnlineLearningModule thanks to a ModuleLearner.
Note the similarity with the ModulesLearner class (I only noticed it
afterwards, so don't mix them up, even though they do very similar
things). A ModuleLearner basically takes an OnlineLearningModule that
has ports named input, target, output and cost, and optimize them.
Typically, you want this OnlineLearningModule to be a NetworkModule that
describes the fancy network architecture originally issued from
Yoshua's brain.

- Look into PLearn/plearn_learners/online/test/ModuleLearner for two
  examples of using a ModuleLearner

- Some random stuff to finish with:
    (1) Use connections with propagate_gradient = 0 if you want for
instance to compute a cost but not optimize on it
    (2) I haven't written yet the class that concatenates various
modules, so you probably can't compute various costs easily, sorry!
(this will probably be my priority this afternoon)
    (3) Due to the flexibility of what you can do, some error messages
may seem cryptic (I need to add some warnings in a few places). In
particular, check that you have properly defined the ports of the
NetworkModule, that there is no missing connection, that you're not
trying to propagate the gradient of a cost to the target, and that
you're not using two modules with the same name (be aware the default
name is the class name)
    (4) There is still a lot to improve in the code. Feel free to mess
with it or email me about your issues/suggestions.
    (5) Only the online mode is supported right now. A way to perform
greedy learning will be added soon (TM)
    (6) Use the RBMModule instead of manually connecting layers (and
keep in mind the ports of a RBMModule are visible and hidden, not input
and output)
    (7) the default ports for a cost are 'prediction', 'target' and
'cost', while the default port for a module are 'input' and 'output'.

Have fun :)
