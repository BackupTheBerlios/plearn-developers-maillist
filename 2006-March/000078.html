<PRE>Hi,

I have installed a buildbot (www.buildbot.org) to run automated builds 
and tests after each commit to PLearn. The setup is not competely 
finished, but it is complete enough to be useful.

Basically, the buildbot listens to commits on the PLearn repository. For 
each new commit it will update its local copy of PLearn to that version, 
compile plearn_full and then run all the pytests. It will note if any of 
these operations failed, keeping a copy of the output produced.

The status (success or failure of each build) is exported in a couple of 
ways. The first one is email. The person who did the commit will receive 
an email letting them know if the build was successful or not. All these 
emails are also send to the new plearn-builds mailing list, to which 
people interested in keeping track of the success of each build can 
subscribe.

There is also a web interface, which for now lives at 
<A HREF="http://janus.apstat.com:8010/">http://janus.apstat.com:8010/</A> where you can see the build history and 
examine the output produced by each build step. There is one column for 
each machine doing builds... right now this is only the ApSTAT i386 
build cluster, but the buildbot software was designed so it is very easy 
to add other machines of different types, even at remote locations 
(like, say, LISA i386 and AMD64 builds).

So if you rely on a class or algorithm of PLearn for your thesis work, 
etc., add a pytest for it in PLearn, people who break your test will now 
get automatically notified!

Enjoy!

  Christian
