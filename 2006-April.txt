Subject: [Plearn-developers] Stochastic hack disabled by default in GradientOptimizer
Message-ID: <20060411181100.GA9422@opale.iro.umontreal.ca>

I changed the value of option 'use_stochastic_hack' from true to false,
as this hack may cause a different behavior (in particular it does not
take Variable box constraints into account).
