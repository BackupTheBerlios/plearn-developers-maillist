<PRE>Hi,

Until now, generating (pseudo)-random numbers in PLearn was a bit
dangerous when mixing different objects, each with its own seed.
I have added a new class: &lt;plearn/math/PRandom.h&gt;, which offers (almost)
the same methods as the 'old' random.h file, but allows each object
needing random numbers to have its own generator (and thus, seed).

I encourage you to use this new object for your future code, and to
convert any existing code that may need it. Note however that, in order
to preserve PLearn's legendary backward-compatibility, there could be a
need for a transition period where the two methods (old and new)
co-exist (with a friendly warning when the old method is used, urging
the user to switch to the new one or be severely tortured).

Basic use is simple. Before you had something like:
  real x = gaussian_mu_sigma(1,4);
which will become
  real x = my_generator.gaussian_mu_sigma(1,4);
where my_generator is a PRandom class member and will have been
initialized at build time by:
  my_generator.manual_seed(seed);
(where seed is possibly -1 to initialize with the CPU time).

If you don't want to have your own class member and don't care about
other parts of the code interfering in your computations, you can use
the static method PRandom::common() which returns a common PP&lt;PRandom&gt;
object usable by everyone. Basically this means you can just do
  real x = PRandom::common()-&gt;gaussian_mu_sigma(1,4);
and even
  real x = PRandom::common(false)-&gt;gaussian_mu_sigma(1,4);
(the second option is if you want to use a PRandom object whose seed is
fixed at compilation time in order to more or less always get the same
numbers, while in the first one the PRandom seed is set by the CPU time
and thus will differ at each execution).

Important note: the underlying code is not the same, thus the same seed
will not generate the same numbers as before. The code is now based on
Boost, which has the advantage of providing more headaches to people
trying to install PLearn, in addition to be open-source (while the old
code is somewhat inspired from Numerical Recipes).

Last, previous random methods are not all available yet, feel free to
add (or tell me) what you need in it.

PS: I'm putting in cc some devs who have not confirmed yet their
subscription to the mailing-list. Please do so as soon as the Berlios
mailing-list is fixed (looks like there's a problem currently).
