<PRE>Hello all PLearners,

Some of you are aware of PLearn's useful logging facility, that's very 
convenient for debugging and testcase creation. In a nutshell, by 
including &lt;plearn/io/pl_log.h&gt;, you can write in your code:

    DBG_LOG &lt;&lt; &quot;Some debugging message&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;

and that message is displayed only when the RUNTIME VERBOSITY LEVEL is 
high enough, for instance when PLearn is invoked with the option:

    plearn --verbosity VLEVEL_DBG

The logs are full-blown PStreams, so any object that can be serialized 
on a PStream can be output in a log.  The following verbosity levels 
(from most important to least important) are supported.  When running at 
a given level (with the --verbosity option), messages at more important 
levels are displayed as well:

    * VLEVEL_IMP: only important messages are displayed
    * VLEVEL_NORMAL: normal logging message
    * VLEVEL_DBG: debug information
    * VLEVEL_EXTREME: extremely-detailed debugging information

That was until now.  *READ ON FOR THE NEW STUFF*.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now consider the following scenario: you're writing a new test case for 
pytest, and you want to enable debug logging only for the new module 
that you're testing (to make sure it's working correctly inside), but 
disable it for other modules.  Until now, this was difficult to do. 

A new feature called NAMED LOGGING allows you to do just that.  It lets 
you perform module-specific logging, meaning that each log operation 
gets a NAME (presumably the module name).  When invoking PLearn, you can 
selectively enable or disable specific log names, so that you only get 
the logs that you want.

Here is how it works.

As always, in your .cc you include the required file from PLearn:

    #include &lt;plearn/io/pl_log.h&gt;
      

Then, within a function for which you want to do logging, you write:

    void foo()
    {
        NAMED_LOG(&quot;MyFancyModule&quot;)
            &lt;&lt; &quot;Output1: &quot; &lt;&lt; complex_object_that_can_be_serialized
            &lt;&lt; &quot;Output2: &quot; &lt;&lt; other_complex_object
            &lt;&lt; endl;

        // ...
    }
      

These outputs are kept if and only if &quot;MyFancyModule&quot; is enabled.  Since 
all named logs ARE DISABLED BY DEFAULT  when starting PLearn you will 
have to enable it, thus:

    plearn --enable-logging MyFancyModule,OtherModule,ThirdModule name_of_script.plearn ...
      

You can also use the special keywords __ALL__ and __NONE__ that 
respectively enable named logging for all modules, and forcibly disable 
all named logging.  Note that named logging operates at the &quot;NORMAL&quot; 
verbosity level for logs, so that if you run at a lower level, you get 
no named logging at all, irrespective of the setting of 
--enable-logging.  Furthermore, if your COMPILATION VERBOSITY is lower 
than the &quot;NORMAL&quot; level, then logging code is not even compiled into 
your executable, thereby taking up no space and no time.

There is also a feature called &quot;module logging&quot; that lets you define a 
&quot;module name&quot; and then carry out named logging using a simple MODULE_LOG 
output stream (with no name, since it is implicit within a module).  
Please see pl_log.h documentation for details.

CONCLUSION: this feature is extremely handy for test cases that must 
output a lot of debug information within a specific test, but for which 
said debugging information would quickly become annoying in normal 
circumstances.  You can set up a pytest case that selectively enables 
logging only for the modules that are currently subjected to test.  
Furthermore, if you decide to add more logging information under a 
module name, other existing test cases (that don't enable this module 
name) don't suddenly fail due to different output.

Comments and suggestions welcome.

    + Nicolas
