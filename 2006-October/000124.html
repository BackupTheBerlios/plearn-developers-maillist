<PRE>Dear PLearners,

A follow-up regarding assertion-handling in PLearn.  It turns out that 
some compilers are VERY VIOLENT against attempts to &quot;override&quot; the 
standard assert() mechanism.  [[You will recall that this is what my 
previous message was about.]]  Since this was starting to cause more 
headaches than could easily be solved by a single bottle of Advil, I had 
to resort to the alternative solution:

*DEFINE OUR OWN ASSERTION-CHECKING MACRO IN PLEARN
*

So I just committed the following macros (in &lt;plearn/base/plerror.h&gt;) ::

   1. PLASSERT(condition): this is just like the standard assert()
      macro, except that it throws an exception on failure. (Same kind
      as a PLERROR at the moment -- Pascal Vincent tells me he might
      change this in the future).
   2. PLASSERT_MSG(condition, message): as above, but with an additional
      explanatory message if the condition fails.

Furthermore, PLearn svn revision 6351 contains a GLOBAL SEARCH-REPLACE 
of all occurrences of assert() to PLASSERT(). IT IS IMPERATIVE that you 
start using PLASSERT() from now on, instead of the standard assert().  
[[Why?  As explained below, the standard assert() aborts the program on 
failure, which is highly unsuitable for running PLearn in server mode.]]

Questions, comments and suggestions are, as always, welcome.

    +Nicolas

</I>&gt;<i> Just a quick note to inform you that I modified the C assertion checking 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism -- when inside PLearn -- to raise an exception (PLERROR) when 
</I>&gt;<i> an exception is not satisfied.  The syntax remains the same as C 
</I>&gt;<i> standard asserts:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     assert(condition);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> except that if &quot;condition&quot; is not satisfied, this produces a PLERROR.  
</I>&gt;<i> The new behavior kicks into play as soon as you include 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;plearn/base/plerror.h&gt;, which is almost everywhere in PLearn.  In 
</I>&gt;<i> addition, I added a macro &quot;pl_assert&quot; which allows one to include a 
</I>&gt;<i> descriptive message as to what the failed condition indicates.  Use it 
</I>&gt;<i> as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     plassert(condition, &quot;This condition indicates a problem in the XYZ subsystem&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As always, when you compile with the -opt option in pymake, these 
</I>&gt;<i> assertions are not actually compiled into your code.  Therefore, you 
</I>&gt;<i> should (liberally) use assertions for checking genuine logic errors in 
</I>&gt;<i> your programs, and not conditions that may result from a user 
</I>&gt;<i> interaction (such as bad values in a script).  Keep using old-fashioned 
</I>&gt;<i> PLERROR for this purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FREQUENTLY-ASKED QUESTIONS
</I>&gt;<i> =====================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Q1) What are the interactions with the C standard &lt;assert.h&gt; mechanism?
</I>&gt;<i> A1) The interaction is as follows: as soon as plerror.h is included, any 
</I>&gt;<i> previous assert macro is undefined, and replaced with this new definition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Q2) What happens if I include &lt;assert.h&gt; after plerror.h?
</I>&gt;<i> A2) Nothing.  The standard assert does not override the PLearn one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Q3) Can I go back to the standard assert mechanism?
</I>&gt;<i> A3) No.  But tell me if this is something you need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Q4) Why bother with this at all?  I thought normal asserts were fine!
</I>&gt;<i> A4) Normal asserts abort the program when the condition is not 
</I>&gt;<i> satisfied.  This is a big no-no for running PLearn in server mode, which 
</I>&gt;<i> should NEVER ABORT.  With this change, any internal error is caught at 
</I>&gt;<i> the top-level, and relayed back to the calling program in the form of an 
</I>&gt;<i> exception, which at least tells the client that something wrong happened 
</I>&gt;<i> instead of just hanging in its face.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wishing all a fully-asserted PLearn future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Cheers,
