<PRE>Hello fellow PLearners,

Just a quick note to inform you that I modified the C assertion checking 
mechanism -- when inside PLearn -- to raise an exception (PLERROR) when 
an exception is not satisfied.  The syntax remains the same as C 
standard asserts:

    assert(condition);

except that if &quot;condition&quot; is not satisfied, this produces a PLERROR.  
The new behavior kicks into play as soon as you include 
&lt;plearn/base/plerror.h&gt;, which is almost everywhere in PLearn.  In 
addition, I added a macro &quot;pl_assert&quot; which allows one to include a 
descriptive message as to what the failed condition indicates.  Use it 
as follows:

    plassert(condition, &quot;This condition indicates a problem in the XYZ subsystem&quot;);

As always, when you compile with the -opt option in pymake, these 
assertions are not actually compiled into your code.  Therefore, you 
should (liberally) use assertions for checking genuine logic errors in 
your programs, and not conditions that may result from a user 
interaction (such as bad values in a script).  Keep using old-fashioned 
PLERROR for this purpose.


FREQUENTLY-ASKED QUESTIONS
=====================

Q1) What are the interactions with the C standard &lt;assert.h&gt; mechanism?
A1) The interaction is as follows: as soon as plerror.h is included, any 
previous assert macro is undefined, and replaced with this new definition.

Q2) What happens if I include &lt;assert.h&gt; after plerror.h?
A2) Nothing.  The standard assert does not override the PLearn one.

Q3) Can I go back to the standard assert mechanism?
A3) No.  But tell me if this is something you need.

Q4) Why bother with this at all?  I thought normal asserts were fine!
A4) Normal asserts abort the program when the condition is not 
satisfied.  This is a big no-no for running PLearn in server mode, which 
should NEVER ABORT.  With this change, any internal error is caught at 
the top-level, and relayed back to the calling program in the form of an 
exception, which at least tells the client that something wrong happened 
instead of just hanging in its face.

Wishing all a fully-asserted PLearn future.

    Cheers,
    + Nicolas
