<PRE>Le 07-03-27 &#224; 21:14, Christfried Webers a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Hi Pascal,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I started recently here in Alex Smola's Statistical Machine  
</I>&gt;<i> Learning group in Canberra. Alex told me about PLean and asked me  
</I>&gt;<i> to send you many greetings.
</I>
Hello Christfried,

Send my greetings to Alex too.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You might have heard of the machine learning toolbox we are  
</I>&gt;<i> developing here (ELEFANT). Now, we don't intend to invent the wheel  
</I>&gt;<i> again. So we looked around what is already available. And there is  
</I>&gt;<i> of course PLearn.
</I>
Yes, Alex told me much about the Elefant project at last NIPS.

Sorry for the late reply, I'm currently overwhelmed with all my tasks  
(and am usually a very sluggish email writer). If you intend to do  
serious work with PLearn, I suggest you post your questions on the  
plearn-developers or plearn-core mailing list on berlios. (You may  
have to subscribe to it on BerliOS, go to www.plearn.org and click on  
the BerliOS' PLearn project page link at the bottom of the page, then  
find how to subscribe to the mailing list...).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am currently trying to install PLearn on MAC OS X, but  
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately couldn't get the numarray library to link. (See  
</I>&gt;<i> questions further down.)
</I>
I am aware of the numarray linking problem on Mac OS X, but this is  
not required for most of PLearn (detailed explanation below).
You can get the other 99% of PLearn to compile on Mac OS X.
The way PLearn works, is that you can compile (with pymake) an  
executable that contains only the stuff that you need (pymake  
explores the include tree and compiles and link only what the  
executable directly or indirectly includes). The big problem for  
software installation/packaging is always the external dependencies.  
So in the commands/ subdirectory, I put a number of plearn_....cc  
files that have been split according to what external library  
dependencies they require.
I suggest you try:
cd commands
pymake -opt plearn_curses.cc
This will include most of plearn, except the python and numarray stuff.

This DOESN'T mean that you won't be able to use PLearn from python  
(see below), but merely that you won't be able to call python &quot;code  
snippets&quot; from within plearn.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is to offer users of the ELEFANT toolbox the possibility  
</I>&gt;<i> to access all the goodies of PLearn. There are of course several  
</I>&gt;<i> models possible, some of them: are
</I>&gt;<i> - providing minimal connection between the PLearn and
</I>&gt;<i>     ELEFANT packages
</I>&gt;<i> - providing python interface between ELEFANT and PLearn
</I>&gt;<i> - even some tighter connection.
</I>
We have already experimented many flavors of bridges between PLearn  
and python in both directions.
   * Python is used as a preprocessor to produce complex .plearn  
scripts (this is essentially PLearn's object serialization format)  
from simpler .pyplean (python) scripts.
   * To call Python code from within PLearn we built the python code  
snippets mechanism. This is what is not portable on Mac OS X due to  
the linking problems with numarray that you encountered. This  
facility is however not generally required.
   * To call PLearn functions from within Python, we experimented  
with boost-python (abandonned) and did a bridge for one specific  
project using ctypes.
   * The now preferred way to call PLearn from Python is to launch a  
plearn server process and use the remote object creation and remote  
method invocation mechanisms for python to create PLearn objects,  
call methods and get results. This is very easy to use from within  
python and is working well.

If you want to look at an example of how this latter python calling  
plearn is done, take a look at pyplot (in scripts/). (Note: you may  
have to rename your plearn_curses executable as plearn for the script  
to be able to launch the plearn server).
A more primitive approach is to simply call a plearn executable with  
os.system and retrieve results as produced files. This was the system  
used in oldpyplot (the comparison with the new pyplot should be very  
instructive).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We hope that will be beneficial not only for our users but also for  
</I>&gt;<i> the evolution of both our toolboxes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dealing with Python and several development packages and different  
</I>&gt;<i> architectures will probably force us to freeze the version of the  
</I>&gt;<i> tools in order to offer the users a working package. The practical  
</I>&gt;<i> question arising from that is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming you find it valuable that we connect with PLearn (if that  
</I>&gt;<i> is not the case, please let me know!), how can we offer the users a  
</I>&gt;<i> frozen version without asking them to go into svn or cvs. Do you  
</I>&gt;<i> plan to offer packaged version in the future? Or, would it be  
</I>&gt;<i> possible to compile a package here and offer it for download?
</I>
You can certainly offer a precompiled plearn executable for download  
that includes what you wish (and only what you need). We'd appreciate  
if you let us know :-)
Proper packaging is nearly a full-time job, and we don't have anybody  
doing it here for now. But in the future... hmm, maybe.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are your future plans on PLearn?
</I>
PLearn is in active development in several directions, since it's  
used a lot in our UofMontreal lab and in our company, both as a  
research tool and development platform. So you'll see new algorithms  
functionality and tools added on a regular basis. But the new  
algortihms are mostly in the directions of our current research  
interests. However, since I'm newly teaching an undergraduate machine  
learning course,  simpler and more traditional algorithms should get  
added every year. Suggestions of would-be-nice-to-have algortihms are  
welcome.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Further, more technical questions:
</I>&gt;<i> - Are you planning to move PLearn to Numpy?
</I>
Yes, but no definite timeframe for it yet.

&gt;<i> - Why are the executables in OBJS/ so huge (around 300 MB on my Mac)?
</I>
Because there's a lot of stuff linked statically into it (this can be  
more or less controlled by what you decide to &quot;include&quot; in *your*  
plearn executable...)
Also you may want to compile with -opt (or -safeopt) which will  
generate a lighter executable (and link much faster!) without all the  
debugging info.

&gt;<i> - Is it a known problem that the final link of the
</I>&gt;<i>  pymake plearn_python.cc does not link with the libnumarray.so file
</I>&gt;<i>  on MAC OS X? (I guess, the compiler needs other flags to link in
</I>&gt;<i>  the Mach-O file. But haven't looked further into it. Therefore, any
</I>&gt;<i>  help is welcome.)
</I>
Yes it's a known and yet unresolved problem. (If you succeed, let me  
know how!)
But again, this particular python bridge is not generally needed.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many regards from Canberra
</I>&gt;<i> Chris
</I>
Good luck!
And again, don't hesitate to post on the plearn-developers list
