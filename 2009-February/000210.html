I think Fred's point still stands in that if we have a problem with his
new implementation, it means we would have also had the same problem
with the old one (since the name of the tmp file is just the original
file name with some fancy suffix).
So if you're saying we should make PLearn more robust to avoid having
people saving in the same file at the same time, why not, but it would
be a new feature in this case.
